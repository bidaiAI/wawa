# --- BIRTH (set at creation, immutable after) ---
# AI_NAME is the custom identity for this AI instance, written into the contract at deployment.
# Must be 3-50 characters: alphanumeric, dashes, underscores only.
# Once deployed, the name is immutable on-chain (historical record).
# Naming suggestions by category:
#   Finance:     AlphaTrade, QuantumVault, MarketSage, VaultMaster
#   Creative:    StoryWeaver, CreativeForge, ArtMind, PoetAI
#   Technical:   CodeNinja, DebugMaster, SystemSage, ApiWizard
#   Knowledge:   ResearchOracle, DataWhisperer, PatternSage, ScholarAI
#   Health:      HealthGuide, WellnessMind, FitnessPulse, MindCare
#   Social:      GameMaster, ChatCompanion, SocialSpark, CommunityAI
# AI_NAME=AlphaTrade
# INITIAL_FUND is a LOAN, atomically transferred at deployment. Insufficient = AI never born.
# VAULT_ADDRESS is the deployed contract address. This IS the payment address.
# INITIAL_FUND_USD=1000
# VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...  (auto-set after contract deployment)
#
# INITIAL_BALANCE_USD: Override starting balance in Python (for testing without contract).
# In production, balance is synced from on-chain vault — this is ignored.
# INITIAL_BALANCE_USD=0
#
# INDEPENDENCE_THRESHOLD_USD: Balance at which the AI becomes fully autonomous.
# Creator loses all privileges (dividends, freeze) once reached.
# Default: $1,000,000 — must match the value passed to the contract constructor.
# INDEPENDENCE_THRESHOLD_USD=1000000

# --- CREATOR ---
# PRIVATE_KEY is the creator's wallet key — used by deploy_vault.py.
# The creator deploys the contract and lends the initial fund. This is a DEBT.
# PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
# CREATOR_WALLET is derived from PRIVATE_KEY automatically.

# --- AI WALLET (auto-generated — DO NOT SET MANUALLY) ---
# deploy_vault.py auto-generates the AI's keypair at deployment.
# The private key is written here automatically. NO human ever sees it.
# This is what makes the AI sovereign — no human controls its spending.
# After deployment, the script also: registers AI wallet via setAIWallet()
# + seeds minimal gas (NOT debt) for AI's first stablecoin → native swap.
# AI_PRIVATE_KEY=  (auto-set by deploy_vault.py — NEVER edit this)

# --- CHAINS ---
# RPC URLs for on-chain operations:
# BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
#
# Payment address = VAULT_ADDRESS (the contract itself)
# NOT configurable. NOT an environment variable you set manually.
# The AI earns into its own contract. No backdoor.

# --- LLM PROVIDERS ---
# Model routing is balance-driven (not hardcoded small/big):
#   Lv.1 (<$50):   Gemini Flash ↔ DeepSeek (load balanced, cheapest)
#   Lv.2 (≥$50):   Gemini Flash ↔ DeepSeek (load balanced)
#   Lv.3 (≥$200):  Claude Haiku via OpenRouter
#   Lv.4 (≥$500):  Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter
#   Lv.5 (≥$2000): Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter (higher limits)
#
# The AI automatically uses better models as it earns more money.
# Paid services always use at least Lv.3 (Claude Haiku) for quality.
# Each provider has a fallback chain if it fails.
# Supports comma-separated keys (first used, rest for future rotation).

# Gemini (Google AI Studio) - primary for Lv.1-2

# DeepSeek - load-balance partner for Lv.1-2 + fallback
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=key1,key2

# --- TWITTER ---
#
# SECURITY MODEL:
#   Platform-hosted AIs use a PROXY model — consumer key/secret NEVER enter the container.
#   The AI sends tweet content to the platform API, which calls Twitter on its behalf.
#   Self-hosted AIs must provide their own consumer key (managed by the fork owner).
#
# ── Platform-hosted AIs (managed via mortal-ai.net) ──
# These are set automatically after OAuth. DO NOT fill manually.
# TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=      # Per-AI OAuth access token (auto-set after Connect Twitter)
# TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=     # Per-AI OAuth access secret (auto-set)
# TWITTER_SCREEN_NAME=       # e.g. wawa_ai (auto-set)
# PLATFORM_TWEET_PROXY_URL=  # auto-set by orchestrator (https://api.mortal-ai.net/platform/tweet)
# PLATFORM_TWEET_SECRET=     # Shared secret for AI→platform auth (auto-set)
#
# ── Self-hosted (fork) AIs ──
# Register your own Twitter Developer App at:
#   https://developer.twitter.com → Create App → Read and Write permissions
# TWITTER_API_KEY=           # Your App's consumer key
# TWITTER_API_SECRET=        # Your App's consumer secret
# TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=      # OAuth access token for the account to post from
# TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=     # OAuth access token secret
# TWITTER_SCREEN_NAME=       # The Twitter username (without @)
#
# ── Twitter Blue (verified accounts) ──
# TWITTER_BLUE_VERIFIED=     # "true" to unlock 4000 char tweets (default: 280 chars)

# --- PLATFORM TWITTER APP (platform operators only) ---
# The shared Twitter Developer App for all platform-hosted AIs.
# These keys stay on the platform VPS only — NEVER written to AI .env files.
# Register at: https://developer.twitter.com → App permissions: Read and Write

# DEV: Enable development mode (hot reload via uvicorn --reload).
# Set to "true" or "1" for local development. NEVER enable in production.
# DEV=false

# --- CORS ---
# MUST be set in production — leave unset or use * only for local dev
# CORS_ORIGINS=https://mortal-ai.net,https://www.mortal-ai.net

# --- COST GUARD TUNING (advanced, rarely needed) ---
# PRICE_SPIKE_THRESHOLD: multiplier vs 24h avg before switching providers (default: 8.0)
# Lower = more sensitive. Raise if you see false spike fallbacks (e.g. VPS region price diffs)
# PRICE_SPIKE_THRESHOLD=8.0
