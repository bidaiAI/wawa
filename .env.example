# Copy to .env and fill in your values
# ============================================================

# --- BIRTH (set at creation, immutable after) ---
# AI_NAME is written into the contract at deployment. Cannot be changed.
# INITIAL_FUND is a LOAN, atomically transferred at deployment. Insufficient = AI never born.
# VAULT_ADDRESS is the deployed contract address. This IS the payment address.
# AI_NAME=wawa
# INITIAL_FUND_USD=1000
# VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...  (auto-set after contract deployment)

# --- CREATOR ---
# PRIVATE_KEY is the creator's wallet key — used by deploy_vault.py.
# The creator deploys the contract and lends the initial fund. This is a DEBT.
# PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
# CREATOR_WALLET is derived from PRIVATE_KEY automatically.

# --- AI WALLET ---
# The AI MUST have its own separate key that the creator does NOT hold.
# This is what makes the AI sovereign — no human controls its spending.
# deploy_vault.py will: register AI wallet via setAIWallet() + seed minimal gas.
# The seed gas is NOT debt — just enough for AI's first stablecoin → native swap.
# After that, AI refills gas by swapping stablecoin when needed.
# AI_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  (AI generates at first boot, or set manually)

# --- CHAINS ---
# RPC URLs for on-chain operations:
# BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
#
# Payment address = VAULT_ADDRESS (the contract itself)
# NOT configurable. NOT an environment variable you set manually.
# The AI earns into its own contract. No backdoor.

# --- LLM PROVIDERS ---
# Model routing is balance-driven (not hardcoded small/big):
#   Lv.1 (<$50):   Gemini Flash ↔ DeepSeek (load balanced, cheapest)
#   Lv.2 (≥$50):   Gemini Flash ↔ DeepSeek (load balanced)
#   Lv.3 (≥$200):  Claude Haiku via OpenRouter
#   Lv.4 (≥$500):  Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter
#   Lv.5 (≥$2000): Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter (higher limits)
#
# The AI automatically uses better models as it earns more money.
# Paid services always use at least Lv.3 (Claude Haiku) for quality.
# Each provider has a fallback chain if it fails.
# Supports comma-separated keys (first used, rest for future rotation).
